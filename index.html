      <p>Hello! I'm a senior at Independence High School's "Space Technology Engineering Academy Magnet" and incoming college freshman who's interested in studying electrical engineering and computer science, particularly embedded systems and computer vision.<br><br>I’m currently searching for remote, hybrid, or onsite internships in the SF Bay Area where I will have the opportunity to “learn by doing” while contributing to the development of exciting new technology.<br><br>Most recently, I was a bioengineering intern at Stanford's School of Engineering and Medicine where I helped design, program, and prototype "Apnostics", a system of wireless biometric sensors for sleep apnea diagnosis. <br><br> In my free time, I love to play video games, build electronic contraptions, collect Lego plants, and support my favorite basketball team, the Golden State Warriors.</p>
